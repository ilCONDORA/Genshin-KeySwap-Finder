Hello guys, before running the program, you need to remove the comment on line 6 of the program, 
where the variable "root_folder" is located, and then assign the path of the "Mods" folder of 3dmigoto. 
If you are downloading this program, you probably know how to easily perform this step. 
However, if you don't know, you can contact me. 


!!! IMPORTANT !!! 
Remember to use double backslashes (\\) in the "root_folder" as shown in the example, otherwise it won't work. 

The explanation is over, I hope you have fun, bye!
