# Genshin-KeySwap-Finder
## ### The repository is divided into `manual-reload` and `automatic-reload`. In `manual-reload`, the user will always have to manually reload the list, whereas in `automatic-reload`, whenever there is a change in the specified folder, the program will automatically perform the reload.

For those of you that have a lot of genshin mods that contains a swap function. This propgram will tell you the name of the mod and the key assigned to it.
